# Frogger #
JavaScript game made for Udacity Google Front-end web development nanodegree program, based on the classic Frogger arcade game!

## Instructions ##
### How to Run ### 
Simply follow [this link](https://miriarte33.github.io/Frogger/) to play the game
### How the game works ###
The game works by saving the location of the enemy and player objects. If the center of the player object is touching the center of any of the enemy objects, then we know there is a collision and the game will be restarted. 
### How to play ###
To move the player up, down, left, or right, move the arrow keys. Make sure to avoid any of the taxis, as that would result in the score being reset back to zero. Reach the water to add on to your score, and see how high it can go!

## Resources ##
Game engine and most of the images (except the taxis) were provided to me by the Udacity team. 

## Contributions ##
Contributions would be greatly appreciated and can be done at any time. Please email me with any questions if necessary. I look forward to adding new features and improving the game.
